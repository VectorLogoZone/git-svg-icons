# To Do

## Scripts

- clean-local: all local files except cache
- clean-deploy: remove files on S3 but not in deploy
- clean-cache: delete local cache

## Long Term

- font blast for repos with font but no svgs
- hotlink detection/prevention/punishment

## Automation

- separate github user account
- watches all repos
- trigger reindex on email receipt
- forks all repos in case they go away

## Maintenance

- cncf - split white into separate source
- picons - split white into separate source
- brandicons - split white into separate sources
- libreicons - brand filter
- vscodeicons - remove file-type-

## Tips

- Github's [search by filename](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code/#search-by-filename) is a good way to find logos (and then repos) with logos
